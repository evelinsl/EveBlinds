# EveBlinds  

Made for Sam! And Sam only!

## Usage

Drop down some blinds, link them up and then:

- Add the *master* script into the *root* prim. That also should be the prim that NEVER moves. So the inner most one.
- Add the *slave* script into all the other linked blinds.
- Reset the *master* script to start the initialization.
